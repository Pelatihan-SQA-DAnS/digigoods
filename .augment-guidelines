# Augment Guidelines

## Code Styles

- Refer to [`.editorconfig`](./.editorconfig) for general code styles such as indentation, line length, end-of-line symbols.
- Run `mvn checkstyle:check` to check for violations of Java code style. If violations found, read the report and try to fix them.

## Testing

- Use JUnit 5 test framework. To run the unit test suite, run `mvn test`.
- Follow the convention of Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) for writing tests, including providing short one-liner comments that denote the sections.
- Since we are using JUnit 5 as the test framework, please note the following when generating tests:
  - Name the test methods more verbosely. It is okay to write the test method name using Given_When_Then format.
  - When naming the test methods using Given_When_Then format, use underscores to separate the words.
  - Add `@DisplayName` annotation to all test methods and use descriptive names as the values of the annotation.
